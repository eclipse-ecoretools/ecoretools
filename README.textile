h1. EMF EcoreTools


The "Ecore Tools":https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emft.ecoretools component provides a complete environment to create, edit and maintain Ecore models. This component eases handling of Ecore models with a Graphical Ecore Editor and bridges to other existing Ecore tools (Validation, Search, Compare, Emfatic, generators...). The Graphical Ecore Editor implements multi-diagram support, a custom tabbed properties view, validation feedbacks, refactoring capabilities... The long-term goal is to provide the same level of services as does JDT for Java.

h2. Building

To build the project you need to install Maven 3. Once you have maven go into the build project @org.eclipse.emf.ecoretools.build@ and type

@mvn clean package@

The final result of the build is an update site in the @org.eclipse.emf.ecoretools.update@ project.

To run the unit tests you'll need to type

@mvn clean verify -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true  --fail-at-end@

@mvn clean verify  --projects org.eclipse.emf.ecoretools.update,org.eclipse.emf.ecoretools.tests -am -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true  --fail-at-end@
